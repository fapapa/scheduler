# Interview Scheduler

## Description

Scheduler is a *single-page application* built with React. It allows a user to
manage interviews on a schedule, and showcases the use of React best practices,
such as pure functions, hooks and custom hooks, and reducers. I also implemented
a set of features that use web-sockets to live-update one user's view when
another user modifies the schedule.
